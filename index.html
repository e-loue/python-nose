      <h1>nose: a discovery-based unittest extension.</h1>

      <p>nose provides an alternate test discovery and running process for
        unittest, one that is intended to mimic the behavior of py.test as much
        as is reasonably possible without resorting to too much magic.

      <h2>Install</h2>

      <p class="note">
        On most UNIX-like systems, you'll probably need to run these commands
        as root or using sudo.
      </p>

      <p>Install nose using setuptools:
        <pre>easy_install nose</pre>
      </p>

      <p>Or, if you don't have setuptools installed, use the download link at
      right to download the source package, and install in the normal fashion:
      Ungzip and untar the source package, cd to the new directory, and:

        <pre>python setup.py install</pre>
      </p>

      <p>If you have an older version of setuptools installed, you may see an
        error like this:
        
        <blockquote>
          <tt>The required version of setuptools (>=0.6c5) is not available, and
          can't be installed while this script is running. Please install
          a more recent version first.</tt>
        </blockquote>
        
        In that case, you'll need to update your setuptools install first,
        either by running:

        <pre>easy_install -U setuptools</pre>

        or:

        <pre>python ez_setup.py</pre>
      </p>
        
      <div class="section">
<h1><a id="basic-usage" name="basic-usage">Basic usage</a></h1>
<p>Use the nosetests script (after installation by setuptools):</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
nosetests [options] [(optional) test files or directories]
</pre>
<p>In addition to passing command-line options, you may also put configuration
options in a .noserc or nose.cfg file in your home directory. These are
standard .ini-style config files. Put your nosetests configuration in a
[nosetests] section, with the -- prefix removed:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
[nosetests]
verbosity=3
with-doctest=1
</pre>
<p>There are several other ways to use the nose test runner besides the
<cite>nosetests</cite> script. You may use nose in a test script:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
import nose
nose.main()
</pre>
<p>If you don't want the test script to exit with 0 on success and 1 on failure
(like unittest.main), use nose.run() instead:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
import nose
result = nose.run()
</pre>
<p><cite>result</cite> will be true if the test run succeeded, or false if any test failed
or raised an uncaught exception. Lastly, you can run nose.core directly, which
will run nose.main():</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
python /path/to/nose/core.py
</pre>
<p>Please see the usage message for the nosetests script for information
about how to control which tests nose runs, which plugins are loaded,
and the test output.</p>

<div class="section">
<h2><a id="writing-tests-is-easier" name="writing-tests-is-easier">Writing tests is easier</a></h2>
<p>nose collects tests from <cite>unittest.TestCase</cite> subclasses, of course. But you can
also write simple test functions, and test classes that are not subclasses of
<cite>unittest.TestCase</cite>. nose also supplies a number of helpful functions for
writing timed tests, testing for exceptions, and other common use cases. See
<a class="reference" href="#writing-tests">Writing tests</a> and <a class="reference" href="#testing-tools">Testing tools</a> for more.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h2><a id="running-tests-is-easier" name="running-tests-is-easier">Running tests is easier</a></h2>
<p>nose collects tests automatically, as long as you follow some simple
guidelines for organizing your library and test code. There's no need
to manually collect test cases into test suites. Running tests is
responsive, since nose begins running tests as soon as the first test
module is loaded. See <a class="reference" href="#finding-and-running-tests">Finding and running tests</a> for more.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h2><a id="setting-up-your-test-environment-is-easier" name="setting-up-your-test-environment-is-easier">Setting up your test environment is easier</a></h2>
<p>nose supports fixtures at the package, module, class, and test case
level, so expensive initialization can be done as infrequently as
possible. See <a class="reference" href="#fixtures">Fixtures</a> for more.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h2><a id="doing-what-you-want-to-do-is-easier" name="doing-what-you-want-to-do-is-easier">Doing what you want to do is easier</a></h2>
<p>nose has plugin hooks for loading, running, watching and reporting on
tests and test runs. If you don't like the default collection scheme,
or it doesn't suit the layout of your project, or you need reports in
a format different from the unittest standard, or you need to collect
some additional information about tests (like code coverage or
profiling data), you can write a plugin to do so. See <a class="reference" href="doc/writing_plugins.html">Writing plugins</a>
for more. nose comes with a number of builtin plugins, for
instance:</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first">Output capture</p>
<p>Unless called with the -s (--nocapture) switch, nose will capture stdout
during each test run, and print the captured output only for tests that
fail or have errors. The captured output is printed immediately
following the error or failure output for the test. (Note that output in
teardown methods is captured, but can't be output with failing tests,
because teardown has not yet run at the time of the failure.)</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Assert introspection</p>
<p>When run with the -d (--detailed-errors) switch, nose will try to output
additional information about the assert expression that failed with each
failing test. Currently, this means that names in the assert expression
will be expanded into any values found for them in the locals or globals
in the frame in which the expression executed.</p>
<p>In other words if you have a test like:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
def test_integers():
    a = 2
    assert a == 4, &quot;assert 2 is 4&quot;
</pre>
<p>You will get output like:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
File &quot;/path/to/file.py&quot;, line XX, in test_integers:
      assert a == 4, &quot;assert 2 is 4&quot;
AssertionError: assert 2 is 4
  &gt;&gt;  assert 2 == 4, &quot;assert 2 is 4&quot;
</pre>
<p>Please note that dotted names are not expanded, and callables are not called
in the expansion.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h2><a id="setuptools-integration" name="setuptools-integration">Setuptools integration</a></h2>
<p>nose may be used with the <a class="reference" href="http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/setuptools">setuptools</a> test command. Simply specify
nose.collector as the test suite in your setup file:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
setup (
    # ...
    test_suite = 'nose.collector'
)
</pre>
<p>Then to find and run tests, you can run:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
python setup.py test
</pre>
<p>When running under setuptools, you can configure nose settings via the
environment variables detailed in the nosetests script usage message,
or the setup.cfg or ~/.noserc or ~/.nose.cfg config files.</p>
<p>Please note that when run under the setuptools test command, some plugins will
not be available, including the builtin coverage, and profiler plugins.</p>
<p>nose also includes its own setuptools command, <cite>nosetests</cite>, that
provides support for all plugins and command line options. See
<a class="reference" href="#commands">nose.commands</a> for more information about the <cite>nosetests</cite> command.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h1><a id="writing-tests" name="writing-tests">Writing tests</a></h1>
<p>As with <a class="reference" href="http://codespeak.net/py/current/doc/test.html">py.test</a>, nose tests need not be subclasses of
<cite>unittest.TestCase</cite>. Any function or class that matches the configured
testMatch regular expression (<cite>(?:^|[b_.-])[Tt]est)</cite> by default --
that is, has test or Test at a word boundary or following a - or _)
and lives in a module that also matches that expression will be run as
a test. For the sake of compatibility with legacy unittest test cases,
nose will also load tests from <cite>unittest.TestCase</cite> subclasses just
like unittest does. Like py.test, functional tests will be run in the
order in which they appear in the module file. TestCase derived tests
and other test classes are run in alphabetical order.</p>
<div class="section">
<h2><a id="fixtures" name="fixtures">Fixtures</a></h2>
<p>nose supports fixtures (setup and teardown methods) at the package,
module, class, and test level. As with py.test or unittest fixtures,
setup always runs before any test (or collection of tests for test
packages and modules); teardown runs if setup has completed
successfully, whether or not the test or tests pass. For more detail
on fixtures at each level, see below.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h2><a id="test-packages" name="test-packages">Test packages</a></h2>
<p>nose allows tests to be grouped into test packages. This allows
package-level setup; for instance, if you need to create a test database
or other data fixture for your tests, you may create it in package setup
and remove it in package teardown once per test run, rather than having to
create and tear it down once per test module or test case.</p>
<p>To create package-level setup and teardown methods, define setup and/or
teardown functions in the <cite>__init__.py</cite> of a test package. Setup methods may
be named <cite>setup</cite>, <cite>setup_package</cite>, <cite>setUp</cite>, or <cite>setUpPackage</cite>; teardown may
be named <cite>teardown</cite>, <cite>teardown_package</cite>, <cite>tearDown</cite> or <cite>tearDownPackage</cite>.
Execution of tests in a test package begins as soon as the first test
module is loaded from the test package.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h2><a id="test-modules" name="test-modules">Test modules</a></h2>
<p>A test module is a python module that matches the testMatch regular
expression. Test modules offer module-level setup and teardown; define the
method <cite>setup</cite>, <cite>setup_module</cite>, <cite>setUp</cite> or <cite>setUpModule</cite> for setup,
<cite>teardown</cite>, <cite>teardown_module</cite>, or <cite>tearDownModule</cite> for teardown. Execution
of tests in a test module begins after all tests are collected.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h2><a id="test-classes" name="test-classes">Test classes</a></h2>
<p>A test class is a class defined in a test module that is either a subclass of
<cite>unittest.TestCase</cite>, or matches testMatch. Test classes that don't descend
from <cite>unittest.TestCase</cite> are run in the same way as those that do: methods in
the class that match testMatch are discovered, and a test case constructed to
run each with a fresh instance of the test class. Like <cite>unittest.TestCase</cite>
subclasses, other test classes may define setUp and tearDown methods that will
be run before and after each test method. Test classes that do not descend
from <cite>unittest.TestCase</cite> may also include generator methods, and class-level
fixtures. Class level fixtures may be named <cite>setup_class</cite>, <cite>setupClass</cite>,
<cite>setUpClass</cite>, <cite>setupAll</cite> or <cite>setUpAll</cite> for set up and <cite>teardown_class</cite>,
<cite>teardownClass</cite>, <cite>tearDownClass</cite>, <cite>teardownAll</cite> or <cite>tearDownAll</cite> for teardown
and must be class methods.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h2><a id="test-functions" name="test-functions">Test functions</a></h2>
<p>Any function in a test module that matches testMatch will be wrapped in a
<cite>FunctionTestCase</cite> and run as a test. The simplest possible failing test is
therefore:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
def test():
    assert False
</pre>
<p>And the simplest passing test:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
def test():
    pass
</pre>
<p>Test functions may define setup and/or teardown attributes, which will be
run before and after the test function, respectively. A convenient way to
do this, especially when several test functions in the same module need
the same setup, is to use the provided with_setup decorator:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
def setup_func():
    # ...

def teardown_func():
    # ...

&#64;with_setup(setup_func, teardown_func)
def test():
    # ...
</pre>
<p>For python 2.3 or earlier, add the attributes by calling the decorator
function like so:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
def test():
    # ...
test = with_setup(setup_func, teardown_func)(test)
</pre>
<p>or by direct assignment:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
test.setup = setup_func
test.teardown = teardown_func
</pre>
<p>Please note that <cite>with_setup</cite> is useful <em>only</em> for test functions, not
for test methods in <cite>unittest.TestCase</cite> subclasses or other test
classes. For those cases, define <cite>setUp</cite> and <cite>tearDown</cite> methods in the
class.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h2><a id="test-generators" name="test-generators">Test generators</a></h2>
<p>nose supports test functions and methods that are generators. A simple
example from nose's selftest suite is probably the best explanation:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
def test_evens():
    for i in range(0, 5):
        yield check_even, i, i*3

def check_even(n, nn):
    assert n % 2 == 0 or nn % 2 == 0
</pre>
<p>This will result in 4 tests. nose will iterate the generator, creating a
function test case wrapper for each tuple it yields. As in the example, test
generators must yield tuples, the first element of which must be a callable
and the remaining elements the arguments to be passed to the callable.</p>
<p>Setup and teardown functions may be used with test generators. The setup and
teardown attributes must be attached to the generator function:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
&#64;with_setup(setup_func, teardown_func)
def test_generator():
    ...
    yield func, arg, arg ...
</pre>
<p>The setup and teardown functions will be executed for each test that the
generator returns.</p>
<p>For generator methods, the setUp and tearDown methods of the class (if any)
will be run before and after each generated test case.</p>
<p>Please note that method generators <em>are not</em> supported in <cite>unittest.TestCase</cite>
subclasses.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h1><a id="finding-and-running-tests" name="finding-and-running-tests">Finding and running tests</a></h1>
<p>nose, by default, follows a few simple rules for test discovery.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>If it looks like a test, it's a test. Names of directories, modules,
classes and functions are compared against the testMatch regular
expression, and those that match are considered tests. Any class that is a
<cite>unittest.TestCase</cite> subclass is also collected, so long as it is inside of a
module that looks like a test.</li>
<li>Directories that don't look like tests and aren't packages are not
inspected.</li>
<li>Packages are always inspected, but they are only collected if they look
like tests. This means that you can include your tests inside of your
packages (somepackage/tests) and nose will collect the tests without
running package code inappropriately.</li>
<li>When a project appears to have library and test code organized into
separate directories, library directories are examined first.</li>
<li>When nose imports a module, it adds that module's directory to sys.path;
when the module is inside of a package, like package.module, it will be
loaded as package.module and the directory of <em>package</em> will be added to
sys.path.</li>
<li>If a object defines a __test__ attribute that does not evaluate to
True, that object will not be collected, nor will any objects it
contains.</li>
</ul>
<p>Be aware that plugins and command line options can change any of those rules.</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<h1><a id="testing-tools" name="testing-tools">Testing tools</a></h1>
<p>The nose.tools module provides a number of testing aids that you may
find useful, including decorators for restricting test execution time
and testing for exceptions, and all of the same assertX methods found
in <cite>unittest.TestCase</cite> (only spelled in pep08 fashion, so <cite>assert_equal</cite>
rather than <cite>assertEqual</cite>). See <a class="reference" href="http://code.google.com/p/python-nose/wiki/TestingTools">nose.tools</a> for a complete list.</p>
</div>

      
      <h2><a name="commands"></a>nosetests setuptools command</h2>

      <p>You can run tests using the <cite>nosetests</cite> setuptools command:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
python setup.py nosetests
</pre>
<p>This command has a few benefits over the standard <cite>test</cite> command: all nose
plugins are supported, and you can configure the test run with both command
line arguments and settings in your setup.cfg file.</p>
<p>To configure the <cite>nosetests</cite> command, add a [nosetests] section to your
setup.cfg. The [nosetests] section can contain any command line arguments that
nosetests supports. The differences between issuing an option on the command
line and adding it to setup.cfg are:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li>In setup.cfg, the -- prefix must be excluded</li>
<li>In setup.cfg, command line flags that take no arguments must be given an
argument flag (1, T or TRUE for active, 0, F or FALSE for inactive)</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Here's an example [nosetests] setup.cfg section:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
[nosetests]
verbosity=1
detailed-errors=1
with-coverage=1
cover-package=nose
debug=nose.loader
pdb=1
pdb-failures=1
</pre>
<p>If you commonly run nosetests with a large number of options, using
the nosetests setuptools command and configuring with setup.cfg can
make running your tests much less tedious. (Note that the same options
and format supported in setup.cfg are supported in all other config
files, and the nosetests script will also load config files.)</p>
<p>Another reason to run tests with the command is that the command will
install packages listed in your <cite>tests_require</cite>, as well as doing a
complete build of your package before running tests. For packages with
dependencies or that build C extensions, using the setuptools command
can be more convenient than building by hand and running the nosetests
script.</p>

      
      <h2><a name="usage"></a>nosetests usage</h2>

      <pre>usage: nosetests [options] [names]
    
    nose provides extended test discovery and running features for
    unittest.
    
    nose collects tests automatically from python source files,
    directories and packages found in its working directory (which
    defaults to the current working directory). Any python source file,
    directory or package that matches the testMatch regular expression
    (by default: (?:^|[\b_\.-])[Tt]est) will be collected as a test (or
    source for collection of tests). In addition, all other packages
    found in the working directory will be examined for python source files
    or directories that match testMatch. Package discovery descends all
    the way down the tree, so package.tests and package.sub.tests and
    package.sub.sub2.tests will all be collected.
    
    Within a test directory or package, any python source file matching
    testMatch will be examined for test cases. Within a test module,
    functions and classes whose names match testMatch and TestCase
    subclasses with any name will be loaded and executed as tests. Tests
    may use the assert keyword or raise AssertionErrors to indicate test
    failure. TestCase subclasses may do the same or use the various
    TestCase methods available.
        
    Selecting Tests
    ---------------

    To specify which tests to run, pass test names on the command line:

      nosetests only_test_this.py

    Test names specified may be file or module names, and may optionally
    indicate the test case to run by separating the module or file name
    from the test case name with a colon. Filenames may be relative or
    absolute. Examples:

      nosetests test.module
      nosetests another.test:TestCase.test_method
      nosetests a.test:TestCase
      nosetests /path/to/test/file.py:test_function
      
    You may also change the working directory where nose looks for tests,
    use the -w switch:

      nosetests -w /path/to/tests

    Note however that support for multiple -w arguments is deprecated
    in this version and will be removed in a future release, since as
    of nose 0.10 you can get the same behavior by specifying the
    target directories *without* the -w switch:

      nosetests /path/to/tests /another/path/to/tests

    Further customization of test selection and loading is possible
    through the use of plugins.

    Test result output is identical to that of unittest, except for
    the additional features (error classes, and plugin-supplied
    features such as output capture and assert introspection) detailed
    in the options below.

    Configuration
    -------------

    In addition to passing command-line options, you may also put configuration
    options in a .noserc or nose.cfg file in your home directory. These are
    standard .ini-style config files. Put your nosetests configuration in a
    [nosetests] section, with the -- prefix removed:

      [nosetests]
      verbosity=3
      with-doctest=1

    All configuration files that are found will be loaded and their options
    combined.
    

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -V, --version         Output nose version and exit
  -p, --plugins         Output list of available plugins and exit. Combine
                        with higher verbosity for greater detail
  -v, --verbose         Be more verbose. [NOSE_VERBOSE]
  --verbosity=VERBOSITY
                        Set verbosity; --verbosity=2 is the same as -v
  -q, --quiet           
  -c FILES, --config=FILES
                        Load configuration from config file(s). May be
                        specified multiple times; in that case, all config
                        files will be loaded and combined
  -w WHERE, --where=WHERE
                        Look for tests in this directory. May be specified
                        multiple times. The first directory passed will be
                        used as the working directory, in place of the current
                        working directory, which is the default. Others will
                        be added to the list of tests to execute. [NOSE_WHERE]
  -m TESTMATCH, --match=TESTMATCH, --testmatch=TESTMATCH
                        Use this regular expression to find tests
                        [NOSE_TESTMATCH]
  --tests=TESTNAMES     Run these tests (comma-separated list). This argument
                        is useful mainly from configuration files; on the
                        command line, just pass the tests to run as additional
                        arguments with no switch.
  -l DEBUG, --debug=DEBUG
                        Activate debug logging for one or more systems.
                        Available debug loggers: nose, nose.importer,
                        nose.inspector, nose.plugins, nose.result and
                        nose.selector. Separate multiple names with a comma.
  --debug-log=DEBUGLOG  Log debug messages to this file (default: sys.stderr)
  --logging-config=LOGGINGCONFIG, --log-config=LOGGINGCONFIG
                        Load logging config from this file -- bypasses all
                        other logging config settings.
  -e EXCLUDE, --exclude=EXCLUDE
                        Don't run tests that match regular expression
                        [NOSE_EXCLUDE]
  -i INCLUDE, --include=INCLUDE
                        Also run tests that match regular expression
                        [NOSE_INCLUDE]
  -x, --stop            Stop running tests after the first error or failure
  -P, --no-path-adjustment
                        Don't make any changes to sys.path when loading tests
                        [NOSE_NOPATH]
  --exe                 Look for tests in python modules that are executable.
                        Normal behavior is to exclude executable modules,
                        since they may not be import-safe [NOSE_INCLUDE_EXE]
  --noexe               DO NOT look for tests in python modules that are
                        executable. (The default on the windows platform is to
                        do so.)
  -a ATTR, --attr=ATTR  Run only tests that have attributes specified by ATTR
                        [NOSE_ATTR]
  -A EXPR, --eval-attr=EXPR
                        Run only tests for whose attributes the Python
                        expression EXPR evaluates to True [NOSE_EVAL_ATTR]
  -s, --nocapture       Don't capture stdout (any stdout output will be
                        printed immediately) [NOSE_NOCAPTURE]
  --with-coverage       Enable plugin Coverage:  If you have Ned Batchelder's
                        coverage module installed, you may activate a coverage
                        report. The coverage report will cover any python
                        source module imported after the start of the test
                        run, excluding modules that match testMatch. If you
                        want to include those modules too, use the --cover-
                        tests switch, or set the NOSE_COVER_TESTS environment
                        variable to a true value. To restrict the coverage
                        report to modules from a particular package or
                        packages, use the --cover-packages switch or the
                        NOSE_COVER_PACKAGES environment variable.
                        [NOSE_WITH_COVERAGE]
  --cover-package=COVER_PACKAGES
                        Restrict coverage output to selected packages
                        [NOSE_COVER_PACKAGE]
  --cover-erase         Erase previously collected coverage statistics before
                        run
  --cover-tests         Include test modules in coverage report
                        [NOSE_COVER_TESTS]
  --cover-inclusive     Include all python files under working directory in
                        coverage report.  Useful for discovering holes in test
                        coverage if not all files are imported by the test
                        suite. [NOSE_COVER_INCLUSIVE]
  --pdb                 Drop into debugger on errors
  --pdb-failures        Drop into debugger on failures
  --no-deprecated       Disable special handling of DeprecatedTest exceptions.
  --with-doctest        Enable plugin Doctest:  Activate doctest plugin to
                        find and run doctests in non-test modules.
                        [NOSE_WITH_DOCTEST]
  --doctest-tests       Also look for doctests in test modules
                        [NOSE_DOCTEST_TESTS]
  --doctest-extension=DOCTESTEXTENSION
                        Also look for doctests in files with this extension
                        [NOSE_DOCTEST_EXTENSION]
  --with-isolation      Enable plugin IsolationPlugin:  Activate the isolation
                        plugin to isolate changes to external modules to a
                        single test module or package. The isolation plugin
                        resets the contents of sys.modules after each test
                        module or package runs to its state before the test.
                        PLEASE NOTE that this plugin should not be used with
                        the coverage plugin in any other case where module
                        reloading may produce undesirable side-effects.
                        [NOSE_WITH_ISOLATION]
  -d, --detailed-errors, --failure-detail
                        Add detail to error output by attempting to evaluate
                        failed asserts [NOSE_DETAILED_ERRORS]
  --with-profile        Enable plugin Profile:  Use this plugin to run tests
                        using the hotshot profiler.   [NOSE_WITH_PROFILE]
  --profile-sort=PROFILE_SORT
                        Set sort order for profiler output
  --profile-stats-file=PROFILE_STATS_FILE
                        Profiler stats file; default is a new temp file on
                        each run
  --profile-restrict=PROFILE_RESTRICT
                        Restrict profiler output. See help for pstats.Stats
                        for details
  --no-skip             Disable special handling of SkipTest exceptions.
  --with-id             Enable plugin TestId:  Activate to add a test id (like
                        #1) to each test name output. After you've run once to
                        generate test ids, you can re-run individual tests by
                        activating the plugin and passing the ids (with or
                        without the # prefix) instead of test names.
                        [NOSE_WITH_ID]
  --id-file=TESTIDFILE  Store test ids found in test runs in this file.

matching the behavior of coverage.py on the command line. Thanks to Bill
Zingler for the bug report.</li>
<li>Added a man page for nosetests. Thanks to Gustavo Noronha Silva for the
request and providing an example.</li>
</ul>
<p>0.9.1</p>
<ul class="simple">

to find and run tests in multiple locations. Thanks Titus Brown for
the suggestion.</li>
<li>Multiple --include and --exclude arguments are now accepted in one command
line. Thanks Michal Kwiatkowski for the feature request.</li>
<li>Coverage will now include modules not imported by any test when
using the new --cover-inclusive switch. Thanks James Casbon for the
patch.</li>
<li>module:TestClass test selections now properly select all tests in the test
class.</li>
<li>startTest and stopTest are now called in plugins at the beginning and end of
test suites, including test modules, as well as individual tests. Thanks

<li>Fix bug in test selection when run as <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">python</span> <span class="pre">setup.py</span> <span class="pre">test</span></tt>: 'test' was
passing through and being used as the test name selection. Thanks Kumar
McMillan for the bug report.</li>
<li>Fix bug in handling of -x/--stop option where the test run would stop on
skipped or deprecated tests. Thanks Kumar McMillan for the bug report.</li>

/lib or /src dirs and tests in a parallel /tests dir.</li>
<li>Fix bug in python version detection. Thanks Kevin Dangoor for the bug report
and fix.</li>
<li>Fix log message in selector that could raise IndexError. Thanks Kumar
McMillan for the bug report and patch.</li>
<li>Fix bug in handling doctest extension arguments specified in environment and
on command line. Thanks Ian Bicking for the bug report.</li>

Bicking for the bug report.</li>
</ul>
<p>0.9.0</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>More unit tests and better test coverage. Numerous bugfixes deriving from
same.</li>
<li>Make --exe option do what it says, and turn it on by default on
Windows. Add --noexe option so windows users can turn if off.Thanks

<ul class="simple">
<li>Fix bug in handling of OR conditions in attrib plugin. Thanks to Titus
Brown for the bug report.</li>
<li>Fix bug in nose.importer that would cause an attribute error when a local
module shadowed a builtin, or other object in sys.modules, without a

with incorrect names in result output.</li>
</ul>
<p>0.9.0a2</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>In TestLoader, use inspect's isfunction() and ismethod() to filter functions

the bug.</li>
<li>Fix doctest plugin: return an empty iterable when no tests are found in a
directory instead of None. Thanks to Kumar McMillan for the bug report and
patch.</li>
<li>Ignore executable python modules, unless run with --exe file. This is a
partial defense against nose causing trouble by loading python modules that
are not import-safe. The full defense: don't write modules that aren't
import safe!</li>
<li>Catch and warn about errors on plugin load instead of dying.</li>
<li>Renamed builtin profile module from nose.plugins.profile to
nose.plugins.prof to avoid shadowing stdlib profile.py module.</li>

decorators, including &#64;raises, contributed by Scot Doyle.</li>
<li>Reimplement nose.main (TestProgram) to have unittest-compatible signature.</li>
<li>All-new import path handling. You can even turn it off! (If you don't,

or module. Like the -f option, -m does not restrict test <em>loading</em>, only
test <em>execution</em>.</li>

sys.path for the duration of the run, not just while importing the module.</li>
<li>Add id() method to all callable test classes, for greater unittest

<p>0.8.6</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Fix bug with coverage output when sys.modules contains entries without
__file__ attributes</li>

<p>0.8.5</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Output capture and verbose assertion errors now work when run like
'python setup.py test', as advertised.</li>
<li>Code coverage improvements: now coverage will be output for all modules
imported by any means that were not in sys.modules at the start of the test
run. By default, test modules will be excluded from the coverage report, but
you can include them with the -t (--cover-tests) option.</li>
</ul>
<p>0.8.4</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Fix bugs in handling of setup/teardown fixtures that could cause TypeError
exceptions in fixtures to be silently ignored, or multiple fixtures of the
same type to run. Thanks to Titus Brown for the bug report.</li>

<li>Fix bug where sys.path would not be set up correctly when running some
tests, producing spurious import errors (Thanks to Titus Brown and Mike
Thomson for the bug reports)</li>
<li>For test classses not derived from unittest.TestCase, output (module.Class)
&quot;doc string&quot; as test description, when method doc string is available
(Thanks to David Keeney for the suggestion, even if this isn't quite what he
meant)</li>
</ul>
<p>0.8.2</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Revise import to bypass sys.path and manipulate sys.modules more
intelligently, ensuring that the test module we think we are loading is the
module we actually load, and that modules loaded by other imports are not
reloaded without cause</li>
<li>Allow test directories inside of packages. Formerly directories matching
testMatch but lacking an __init__.py would cause an ImportError when located

<li>Fix bug where module setup could be called twice and teardown skipped
for certain setup method names.</li>
<li>main() returns success value, does not exit. run_exit() added to support

<p>nose was inspired mainly by <a class="reference" href="http://codespeak.net/py/current/doc/test.html">py.test</a>, which is a great test runner, but
formerly was not all that easy to install, and is not based on unittest.</p>
<p>Test suites written for use with nose should work equally well with py.test,
and vice versa, except for the differences in output capture and command line
arguments for the respective tools.</p>
