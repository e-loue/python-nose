New in version 0.9.1
--------------------

Nose 0.9.1 is mainly a bug-fix release, but it does contain a few new
features.

* The --where (-w), --include and --exclude arguments may now all appear
  multiple times in a single command line, allowing easier running of
  multiple test suites and test suites with more diverse layouts.
* For programmatic use, nose.runmodule() was added. Similar to
  doctest.runmodule() and unittest.main(), nose.runmodule() will load and run
  tests in the current module, which defaults to __main__.
* A number of changes to plugins and plugin hooks make current plugins work
  better and allow more interesting plugins to be written.

Just about everything in this release was driven by requests from
users. Thanks to the many folks who filed bug reports and suggested features,
ideas and solutions to thorny problems.
