New in version 0.9.3
--------------------

nose 0.9.3 is mainly a bugfix release. The one new feature is support for user
configuration files: now you can put your frequently used configuration
options in .noserc or nose.cfg files, rather than typing them over and over
and over again. Many thanks to Antoine Pitrou for that patch, and thanks to
the users who reported bugs and submitted patches and suggestions.

Barring catastrophic bugs, this will be the last release of nose in the 0.9
series. An alpha release of nose 0.10 should be forthcoming within a few
weeks. Details about the new features and architecture changes in nose 0.10
may be found here_.
