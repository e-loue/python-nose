New in version 0.9.2
--------------------

Nose 0.9.2 includes quite a few bug fixes and new features. The most
significant are the new nosetests setuptools command, contributed by
James Casbon, better support for python 2.2 thanks to a patch from
Chad Whitacre, and some useful utilities for testing Twisted programs
and writing decorators contributed by Antoine Pitrou. Thanks to them
all, and the many other folks who contributed patches and filed bug
reports and feature requests.

Nose's project home has also moved from python hosting to Google
code. Please update your svn checkouts and bookmarks. To check out the
current trunk: svn co http://python-nose.googlecode.com/svn/trunk. To
