 isolation * post merge
   - need loadTestFromNames hook to make this work -- must be able to take over
     completely and be (or use internally at least) a generator. This is 
     needed because the plugin needs to isolate a import time, not just 
     test-run time.

older notes:
   not sure how this one can be made to work at the module level, since
   import and testrunning take place separately now -- mods a, b, c are all 
   imported before tests are run in a. probably best to have it work at the
   directory and context levels -- that will get pretty close to what it
   does in 0.9

   it can be made to work only in surrounding contexts that are generators:
      hook before
      load and yield suite
      hook after
   
   needed in 2 places -- loadTestsFromDir, loadTestsFromNames. 
   So loadTestsFromNames will have to become lazy -- what impact will that
     have on unittest compatibility, etc? can it just return a lazysuite?

     the problem with loadTestsFromNames is that context teardown requires
     that for a given context, all tests within the context are known before
     teardown of the first suite within the context. Say you have a package of 
     tests, a, with subpackages a.b and a.c. User wants to run tests a.b.test 
     and a.c.test:

     nosetests a.b.test a.c.test

     'a' and 'b' setup and 'b' teardown run naturally with the 1st test
     'c' setup and teardown run natually with the 2nd test. But when, or
     how, does 'a' teardown run? If all tests are known, then a.c.test can
     run a teardown, because it knows that no more tests in 'a' are going
     to run. But if the 2 tests are loaded lazily -- as is REQUIRED for 
     the isolation plugin -- then 1st test will mistakenly run 'a' teardown, 
     since it doesn't know as it is torn down that another test in the
     same context is about to load.

     can't fix this by a call at the end of the loading process, since then
     context teardowns may interleave -- 'a' and 'b' may be present at once

     can only fix it by forcing full context load & unload around each
     test WHEN USING loadTestFromNames -- this is inefficient, but unavoidable
     without controlling the *order* of tests passed to loadTestsFromNames.


new plugin:
 testid
  -- needs loadTestsFromNames hook


rename Failure and split into subclasses for Import and other, and make
it optionally include the name of the file being considered so that
Failure test logs can be more informative


* plugin methods to add

before/after Context [in suite, call with parent]
makeTest
prepareTestCase
loadTestsFromName

when result prints final result, patch in error classes, eg,

FAILED (todo=10)
  or
OK (skipped=2)

** this can only be done in nose test runner

make setup work with & w/out setuptools

fix commands module -- use Config.configure to configure

fix collector func -- configure, return loader.loadTestsFromNames()


BUGS

--exclude doesn't seem to work? in some cases?

-- when run vs spine suite, makeTest seemingly was called on an object
   that should not have passed the selector --
   sqlalchemy.sql._FunctionGateway, which doesn't match testmatch and
   isn't a testcase subclass -- need to look into it further.


MERGE merge trunk -> 0.10 from r9 to pick up trunk changes/fixes

REMOVE the context class entirely? is it doing anything that 
suite and case.Test shouldn't more properly do?

tests for:

module-level setup skip: skip all
likewise deprecated
likewise error

plugins:

plugin manager class
replace call_plugins with proxied call through plugin manager
  how to handle diff cases where plugs may short circuit on first non-None
  response or where all non-None responses are taken?

result/result proxy:

SUITES also need to proxy their results

result takes config
implements beforeTest, afterTest
result proxy should be a plugin?
what plugin hook is needed for that?

supporting result proxy in context:

 call context.prepareTest() before each test? no
 need to have a hook for context (or test case) 
 to replace/wrap the result
