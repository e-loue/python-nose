fix test_loader unittest -- move the mock stuff to another module that it
  can import in its setup

* plugin methods to add

before/after Directory
before/after Import
before/after Context [in suite, call with parent]
makeTest


...

REMOVE the context class entirely? is it doing anything that 
suite and case.Test shouldn't more properly do?

tests for:

module-level setup skip: skip all
likewise deprecated
likewise error

plugins:

plugin manager class
replace call_plugins with proxied call through plugin manager
  how to handle diff cases where plugs may short circuit on first non-None
  response or where all non-None responses are taken?

result/result proxy:

SUITES also need to proxy their results

result takes config
implements beforeTest, afterTest
result proxy should be a plugin?
what plugin hook is needed for that?

supporting result proxy in context:

 call context.prepareTest() before each test? no
 need to have a hook for context (or test case) 
 to replace/wrap the result
