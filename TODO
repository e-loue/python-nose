implement pdb/pdb-fail as plugin
 -- what to do about error classes? would be ideal
    not to trigger pdb, output capture, etc on items caught
    by error classes, but there's no avenue for that to happen
    unless the plugin stores a result ref on prepareResult, 
    which is rather hackish and tightly coupled. Can the result do
    something to the error that it handles as an errorClass, something
    that the plugin can see in a non hackish way?
implement output capture as plugin
implement assert inspection as plugin
implement deprecated test exception as plugin

fix test_loader unittest -- move the mock stuff to another module that it
  can import in its setup

* plugin methods to add

before/after Directory
before/after Import
before/after Context [in suite, call with parent]
makeTest

BUGS

calls with odd names produce bad errors

missing module -- tries to import even though path is None
non-module name -- passes None to nose.caseTest

missing last test result tag when it's an error? or always
or just when running test_utils.py since last test fails?

...

REMOVE the context class entirely? is it doing anything that 
suite and case.Test shouldn't more properly do?

tests for:

module-level setup skip: skip all
likewise deprecated
likewise error

plugins:

plugin manager class
replace call_plugins with proxied call through plugin manager
  how to handle diff cases where plugs may short circuit on first non-None
  response or where all non-None responses are taken?

result/result proxy:

SUITES also need to proxy their results

result takes config
implements beforeTest, afterTest
result proxy should be a plugin?
what plugin hook is needed for that?

supporting result proxy in context:

 call context.prepareTest() before each test? no
 need to have a hook for context (or test case) 
 to replace/wrap the result
