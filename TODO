implement assert inspection as plugin
deprecated needs to be added to builtin plug list

fix builtin plugins:
 attrib
 coverage
 doctest
 prof
 isolation * post merge

remove plugins:
 missing

new plugin:
 testid


* plugin methods to add

before/after Directory
before/after Import
before/after Context [in suite, call with parent]
makeTest

when result prints final result, patch in error classes, eg,

FAILED (todo=10)
  or
OK (skipped=2)

** this can only be done in nose test runner

make setup work with & w/out setuptools


BUGS

--exclude doesn't seem to work? in some cases?



MERGE merge trunk -> 0.10 from r9 to pick up trunk changes/fixes

...

REMOVE the context class entirely? is it doing anything that 
suite and case.Test shouldn't more properly do?

tests for:

module-level setup skip: skip all
likewise deprecated
likewise error

plugins:

plugin manager class
replace call_plugins with proxied call through plugin manager
  how to handle diff cases where plugs may short circuit on first non-None
  response or where all non-None responses are taken?

result/result proxy:

SUITES also need to proxy their results

result takes config
implements beforeTest, afterTest
result proxy should be a plugin?
what plugin hook is needed for that?

supporting result proxy in context:

 call context.prepareTest() before each test? no
 need to have a hook for context (or test case) 
 to replace/wrap the result
